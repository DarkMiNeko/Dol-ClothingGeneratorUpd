# dol Custom Beautification Mod Generator - ONLY .PY is TRANSLATED
A beginner-friendly mod generator created by Polaris, designed to generate mod packages compatible with ModLoader.
⚠️ This tool only supports pure visual (beautification) mods — no functional or clothing additions.

How to Use:

    1.Copy your custom img folder into this directory and merge it with the existing img folder.

    2.If you have Python installed, double-click "dolCBMG.py" to run the generator.

    3.If you don’t have Python, double-click "dolCBMG.exe" instead.

    4.Follow the prompts to enter your mod name and version number.

    5.Press Enter, and wait until you see the message “Mod successfully generated”.

    6.A ".zip" archive will be created in this folder — that is your finished mod package.

    ps. When creating a new mod, be sure to delete any existing img folder to avoid conflicts.
