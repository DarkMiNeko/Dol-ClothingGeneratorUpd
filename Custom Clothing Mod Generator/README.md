# DoL Custom Clothing Mod Auto Generator - ONLY .PY is TRANSLATED
A beginner-friendly mod generator created by Polaris, designed to automatically create mod packages compatible with ModLoader. Supports both new clothing additions and visual/beautification mods.

How to Use: 

    1.Copy and paste the new clothing code into the corresponding ".json" file inside the clothes folder.

    2.Copy your new "img" folder into this directory and merge it with the existing "img" folder.

    3.If you have Python installed, double-click "dolCCMG.py" to launch the generator.

    4.If you don’t have Python, double-click "dolCCMG.exe" instead.

    5.Follow the prompts to enter your mod name and version number.

    6.Press Enter, and wait until you see the message “Mod successfully generated”.

    7.A ".zip" archive will be created in this directory — that’s your mod package!

    ps. When creating a new mod from scratch, you can delete the clothes folder.
        The generator will recreate initial .json files for you automatically.
