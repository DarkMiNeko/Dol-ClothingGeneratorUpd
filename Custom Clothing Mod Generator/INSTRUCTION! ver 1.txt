* Full instructions (hopefully)

1) download folder "Custom Clothing Mod Generator"
2) run dolCCMG once to create folders (exe or py)
3) go to sheet link and make copy for yourself (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_yd3uq0nf1mKuK3GGFb_i4Pc8Qiykc9c-KLLU8A0oAw/edit?usp=sharing)
4) edit C column as you like/need
5) Copy line next to "Modloader generation code"
6) Paste code in slot.json (upper, lower, ect) don't worry about formating for now. 
!!!! - If no python... You had to edit it by hand to look as in sheet but inside [ ]
7) *There's python needed - run "slot-fix.py", it would fix wonky formatting of copied code
8) add clothing img into img folder as in dol folder structure.
9) run dolCCMG exe, but better dolCCMG.py, while it's translated and has more functions
10) input things and TADA, there would be hopefully working archive

If it won't work, send me, I would edit it by hand. Send msgs here https://discord.com/channels/675158131688603721/1382079450258346034
